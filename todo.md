# To Do

1. Fun shader: Blobs!
    - Now that we figured out interpolation, non-linear scaling/mapping, and phasing, as well as have a better idea of how to write our functions (thanks Hydra!),
      it's time to put together a toy for demo palooza!
2. Can we only use the exponential function without interpolation (eg. for circle radius)?

1. Phasers
    - Paired with David Allen Feil, who helped me approach the problem from a new angle
    - Specifically, instead of thinking about changing the frequency and how it relates to time, to
      forget about time, because time is simply phase. We can keep track of phase (from 0 to 2PI) 
      and at each frame increment it by a velocity vector tied to a Midi CC. 
    - We also played around with using non-linear functions to have finer control at specific points, for example
      when modifying a circle radius, we'll want finer control when it's small (at lower values of the potentiometer),
      so we can use an exponential function for it. Or, when using a phaser, we can use bell and S curves to achieve
      different effects. An (inverted) s-curve from -1 to 1 achieved a cool effect of going either backwards of forwards in the phase.

1. bindUniformToCh
    - For oscillators
2. First try at oscillators
    - Works better, but not as well as I would like too. Somestimes the movement is smooth. Sometimes it's not.

0. MIDI Channels
    - Reading multiple MIDI channels with WebMIDI
    device.addListener("controlchange", e => {
      if (e.message.channel == channel) {
        callback(e.controller.number, e.value);
      }
    });

a. Circle
    1. Initial Value
    2. Interpolation

1. Research Limits of MIDI
    - Close to impossible to work around
    - Perhaps better to use something like OSC
        - Could use TouchOSC with some kind of library
        - Cons: Looks like it requires setting up a web server
